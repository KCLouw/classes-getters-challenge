//Create a class called Tasks
    //Make sure your class has a constructor with a private variable
    //Within your Constructor, make sure you have a parameter of task which is equal to a private variable in your constructor
    //Create a getter that returns the variable within your constructor
    //Add your code below

    class Tasks{
        constructor(task){
            this._task = task;
        };

        get task(){

        };
    };
    

    //Instantiate your Task class and store the object in a variable
    //Console log your Tasks object, by calling the getter
    //Your code should look like the example below:
      //const myObject = new Tasks('whatsup')
      //console.log(myObject.task)
    //Add your code below

    const football = new Tasks("Football Match");
    console.log(football.task);
